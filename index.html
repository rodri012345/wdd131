                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>My name is Rodrigo and I go by Rodry. I was born in Cochabamba, Bolivia. I'm currently studying
                        software development. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of later day-saints
                        since 2006. It was a greate blessing for me to know the church and be baptize.
                        I like to play soccer and go to the gym. In my free time I enjoy playing guitar and
                        listen to music. I have served a mission in Colombia Barranquilla Mission, in 2015 to 2017, that
                        experience changed my life, I have learned a lot and new so many good people.
                        We are 4 in my family, my mom, dad and my younger sister. I love my family, they have always
                        supported me in my goals and in my proyects. I'm happy to be studying at BYU - Idaho, for me it
                        is a great oportunity to grow and improve my knowlage.

                        Por supuesto, aquÃ­ tienes un pÃ¡rrafo en inglÃ©s sobre Bolivia:
                        Bolivia is a captivating South American country known for its diverse geography, vibrant
                        culture, and historical richness. Its landscapes range from the high-altitude Andes mountains to
                        the vast Amazon rainforest, offering visitors stunning natural beauty. Among the top tourist
                        destinations are the Salar de Uyuni, the worldâ€™s largest salt flat, which transforms into a
                        massive mirror during the rainy season; Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the world;
                        and La Paz, the countryâ€™s unique capital city nestled in a dramatic valley. Bolivia also boasts
                        the stunning Madidi National Park, a biodiversity hotspot in the Amazon basin. The countryâ€™s
                        climate varies significantly, with colder temperatures in the mountainous regions and warm,
                        tropical conditions in the lowlands. Visitors to Bolivia will experience not only breathtaking
                        landscapes but also rich indigenous cultures, fascinating colonial history, and vibrant
                        festivals, making it a unique and unforgettable travel destination.

    <h2>Site Name</h2>
<p>Motorcycle Club City</p>
<p>I chose this name because it represents a local club dedicated to motorcycle enthusiasts, giving a sense of community and belonging. It’s easy to remember and reflects the identity of the city.</p>

<h2>Site Purpose</h2>
<p>The site’s purpose is to provide information about the motorcycle club, including its history, events, photos, and how to join. It serves as a platform to keep members informed and attract new people interested in joining the club.</p>

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

  <li>What are the upcoming events of the club?</li>
  <li>How can I join the club and participate in the activities?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Color Schema</h2>
<p><strong>Color 1:</strong> #1E1E1E (background and main headings)</p>
<p><strong>Color 2:</strong> #FF5733 (accent color for buttons and links)</p>

<h2>Typography</h2>
<p><strong>Font 1:</strong> Arial, for the body text.</p>
<p><strong>Font 2:</strong> Montserrat, for headings and titles.</p>

<p>A simple design where the header is visible at the top, followed by a collapsible navigation menu, a featured image of the bike in the main section, and a contact form at the footer.</p>

<p>The layout includes a fixed navigation bar at the top, a hero image spanning the header, a central body with a list of events, and a photo gallery in a grid, with a contact form and map in the footer.</p>
